## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Farmart (Market Linkage Team) - Senior Software Engineer

**JAN 2023 - DEC 2023**

- I worked on an internal B2B ERP tool, which helped the business grow 5x.
- Migrated old codebase to MVVM with controllers and model hooks for each component. Used TypeScript generics to build reusable small modules for tables, virtual lists, form items, etc.
- Built a simple abstraction that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the `useState` hook to save session data in session storage, preventing users from losing progress while switching pages.
- Developed a utility module similar to react-query that can be used with Redux to cache API calls in the Redux state. The benefits were strong typing for both requests, query params, responses, and errors.

**Tech Used**: React, Node.js, TypeScript, MySQL, Redux, Material Component
